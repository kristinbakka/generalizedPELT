# generalizedPELT
The code from my master's thesis June 2018 on Pruned Exact Linear Time generalized for estimation of multiple parameters. Implemented with cost functions for univariate and multivariate Gaussian distributed data.

Install package:
```{r,eval=FALSE,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
library(devtools)
install_github("kristinbakka/generalizedPELT")
```

See the files test-multivariate.R, test-univariate.R and plot-univariate.R for how to use it.

The most important funcions (op and gpelt) are found in R/mycpt.R.
